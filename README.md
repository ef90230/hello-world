This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I'm a third-year student at MSU (as of this commit). I'm working toward a Computer Science degree with a Mass Communications minor. I studied abroad in London in early 2024. Eventually, I want to work as a subcontractor for the federal government using the skills I have acquired.
